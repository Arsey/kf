Sitemap
=======

The ``SonataSeoBundle`` provides a support for static sitemap generation.

You will need to configure:
 - a Doctrine connection
 - a route
 - default parameters used by the route
 - the query which must contains all informations required by a sitemap: lastmod, changefreq and priority

The url is generated by using ``route`` and ``parameters`` settings.

For performance reasons and memory usage there is no model hydrated while generating the sitemap. So if the sitemap requires
specific rules, they must be expressed in the ``WHERE`` condition. The query must select fields to be used in the route.

The following code is an extract of the query required to generate a valid sitemap for the ``SonataNewsBundle``

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS('/', YEAR(created_at), MONTH(created_at), DAY(created_at), slug) as permalink ,
        updated_at as lastmod,
        'weekly' as changefreq,
        '0.5' as priority
    FROM news__post
    WHERE
            enabled = 1
        AND (publication_date_start IS NULL OR publication_date_start <= NOW())


Please note: the ``changefreq`` and the ``priority`` fields are optional.

Configuration example
---------------------

Sitemap configuration obviously depends on the bundle, page types & custom routes you choose to expose.
Here is a full example coming from the [Sonata Sandbox demo website](https://github.com/sonata-project/sandbox) 

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_seo:
        # ...
        sitemap:
            doctrine_orm:
                # media
                - { types: [image], connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: sonata_media_view,       parameters: {id: null},                               query: "SELECT id, updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as priority FROM media__media WHERE enabled = true" }
                # blog post
                - { group: "news",  connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: sonata_news_view,        parameters: {permalink: null},                        query: "SELECT CONCAT_WS('/', YEAR(created_at), MONTH(created_at), DAY(created_at), slug) as permalink , updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as priority FROM news__post WHERE enabled = 1 AND (publication_date_start IS NULL OR publication_date_start <= NOW())" }
                # page - works only for one site, please adapt the code if required
                - {                 connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: page_slug,               parameters: {path: null},                             query: "SELECT url as path, updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as priority FROM page__snapshot WHERE route_name = 'page_slug' AND enabled = 1 AND (publication_date_start IS NULL OR publication_date_start <= NOW())" }
                # product categories
                - {                 connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: sonata_catalog_category, parameters: {category_id: null, category_slug: null}, query: "SELECT id as category_id, slug as category_slug, updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as priority FROM classification__category WHERE enabled = true" }
                # products
                - {                 connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection, route: sonata_product_view,     parameters: {productId: null, slug: null},            query: "SELECT id as productId, slug, updated_at as lastmod, 'weekly' as changefreq, '0.5' as priority FROM product__product WHERE enabled = true" }
